                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Pantsula developed in the townships of Johannesburg in the 1950s and 1960s. It emerged as a response to the social and political upheavals of the time. This form of dance became a vehicle for social commentary and political resistance during apartheid, expressing the lived realities of black South Africans.</p>

                <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
                <p>Pantsula is a lively and electrifying dance form that expresses the very essence of township culture it's a kind of social commentary, all wrapped up in an impromptu street performance, addressing everything from daily life to high politics. You're just as apt to see young men dancing this as you are to see them embracing hip-hop or variations of that, and in fact, those subcultures share a lot of the same community spaces.</p>
